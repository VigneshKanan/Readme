# Push Protection Block

This document outlines the recommended steps and guidelines for implementing push protection measures to safeguard the integrity and security of the codebase.

## 1. Branch Protection

Branch protection rules are essential for preventing unauthorized changes to critical branches. Follow these steps to configure branch protection:

- **Navigate to Branch Settings**: Go to the repository settings and locate the branch protection settings.
- **Enable Branch Protection**: Enable branch protection for critical branches such as `master` or `main`.
- **Define Protection Rules**: Specify rules such as requiring pull request reviews, status checks, and restrictions on force-pushes and deletions.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Branch Protection Guide](wiki/Branch-Protection-Guide.md).

## 2. Pre-Commit Hooks

Pre-commit hooks provide an additional layer of defense by enforcing checks on code changes before they are committed. Here's how to set up pre-commit hooks:

- **Install Pre-Commit Framework**: Install and configure the pre-commit framework in your repository.
- **Configure Hooks**: Define hooks to enforce coding standards, run tests, and prevent committing sensitive information.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Pre-Commit Hooks Setup](wiki/Pre-Commit-Hooks-Setup.md).

## 3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)

Enabling two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to user accounts. Follow these steps to enable 2FA:

- **Access Account Settings**: Navigate to the user account settings in the repository.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: Follow the prompts to enable 2FA and configure authentication methods.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Two-Factor Authentication Setup](wiki/Two-Factor-Authentication-Setup.md).

## 4. Regular Security Audits

Regular security audits help identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with security best practices. Here's how to conduct security audits:

- **Schedule Audits**: Establish a schedule for conducting regular security audits.
- **Review Access Permissions**: Audit access permissions to the repository and associated resources.
- **Identify Vulnerabilities**: Use automated tools and manual inspections to identify security vulnerabilities.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Security Audit Guidelines](wiki/Security-Audit-Guidelines.md).

## 5. Limited Write Access

Limiting write access to the repository helps control changes and minimize the risk of unauthorized modifications. Follow these steps to manage write access:

- **Define Access Roles**: Define roles and permissions for contributors based on their responsibilities.
- **Grant Write Access Selectively**: Grant write access only to authorized individuals who require it for their tasks.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Write Access Management](wiki/Write-Access-Management.md).

## 6. Continuous Monitoring

Continuous monitoring of repository activities and access logs is crucial for detecting and responding to security incidents. Here's how to set up continuous monitoring:

- **Leverage Monitoring Tools**: Use monitoring tools and services to track repository activities and access logs.
- **Set Up Alerts**: Configure alerts for suspicious activities and security events.

For detailed instructions, refer to the [Continuous Monitoring Setup](wiki/Continuous-Monitoring-Setup.md).

## Conclusion

Implementing push protection measures is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of the codebase. By following these recommended steps and guidelines, you can effectively mitigate the risk of unauthorized changes and ensure the reliability of the software development process.
